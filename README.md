# Evaluating squat performance using deep learning and computer vision

## Introduction
The fields of physical rehabilitation, physiotherapy and athletic coaching can intersect at a common technique: functional movement screening. This project aims to automate the screening process for one exercise using neural networks. The target will be to evaluate squat performance from a video. The squat is an total-body compound movement which has great utility in our every day lives and sports.
