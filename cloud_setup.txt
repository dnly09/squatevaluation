4. Command to see hashed password: cat /jet/etc/jupyter_notebook/jupyter_notebook_config.json
(record or copy this password somewhere)
5. Command to edit config: nano /jet/etc/jupyter_notebook/jupyter_notebook_config.py
6. At the very top, type in the following once you have the config file opened:
c.NotebookApp.ip = 'internal IP address here'
c.NotebookApp.password = u'full password from step 4'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port = 8888
7. Type in jupyter lab/notebook to start your instance
8. Copy your VM's external IP address into your browser and add ':8888'
9. Submit the password you used to create this instance
10. Now you are connected to your jupyter lab/notebook instance on the cloud
